## Project Overview

The primary goal of this project is to accurately detect pneumonia from chest X-ray images. This is achieved through the following key steps:

1.	Import Libraries: Load all the necessary libraries required for data manipulation, visualization, and model building.

2.	Define Function for Training: Create functions to handle the training process.

3.	Train Phase: Train the VGG16 model on the prepared dataset using transfer learning.

4.	Evaluate Model Performance: Assess the model's performance using various evaluation metrics.

5.	Testing Phase: Test the model on unseen data to evaluate its generalization capability.

6.	Results: Display the results and visualizations.

## Libraries Used
